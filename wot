  <overview>
  <overviewtext> I studied computer games and animation sciences for three
years. In 2023, I graduated with a professional bachelor's
degree in computer science. I have experience in game
creation, modeling, layout, graphic design and video editing. I
am amazed by computer games, and I would like to get a
chance to improve myself and learn new things about the
industry. I know that not having any experience slims chances,
but I'm willing to start by low paygrade and move upwards as I
progress. </overviewtext>
